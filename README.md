* .env.local - This file is loaded for all environments except test environment. You can add your key there during development, testing purposes Add your API key inside the curly brackets REACT_APP_APPID={Your API KEY}
* .env - add your API key for build script inside this file or as part of your CI/CD build pipeline

<br> Your can read more on embedding custom environment variables here (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)
